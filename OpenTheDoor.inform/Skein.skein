&quot;No! Wait guys! Don&apos;t do this!&quot; Your friends push you out of the bedroom, and lock the door behind you. In your own house! Well, at least you know where the key is to to get back in...wait...do you?

Open the Door
An Interactive Fiction by Dylan Vodzak
Release 1 / Serial number 141007 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Family Room
This is where you and your friends were hanging out earlier. A carpet is in the middle of the room. A painting is on the north wall. A dresser is in the northwest corner of the room, while an armchair is in the southwest corner. An urn is near the door to the office in the northeast. The office is to the east. Your room is to the south.

You can see a red dresser (closed) here.

Study
A hangout area for the house other then the family room. You remember that the lightbulb sputtered out while you and your friends were in there, making everyone retreat to your room. There is a grandfather clock in the the northwest corner of the room. A couch is resting against the north wall, and a potted ficus is in the southwest corner. A rug is sprawled across the floor. The guest bedroom is to the east, and the office is to the south.

You can see a brass key here.
