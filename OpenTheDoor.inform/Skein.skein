Office
This is your dad&apos;s office. However he doesn&apos;t use it a whole lot. You and your friends were only in here for a bit, but then you all moved to the guest bedroom, which is east of the study. There is a brown desk in the southwest corner. A bookcase is in the northwest corner, and a shelf is against the east wall. The family room is to the west and the study is to the north.

Bedroom
The guest bedroom is where your parents sleep. Your room is actually the main bedroom, but your parents were nice enough to switch. A king sized bed is in the northeast corner, while a TV is in the northwest corner. There is also a black desk on the south wall, and a yellow trunk in the southwest corner. The study is back to the west.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A safe that is mounted on the north wall of the room. Your parents just installed it, so the only thing that should be in there is a flashlight that your dad was using to mount it. It appears to have a combination lock. What were your parents thinking when they decided to put this in here?

(HINT: When unlocking the safe, type: spin dial to {Entire Value Here}

For example: spin dial to 1234)

Office
This is your dad&apos;s office. However he doesn&apos;t use it a whole lot. You and your friends were only in here for a bit, but then you all moved to the guest bedroom, which is east of the study. There is a brown desk in the southwest corner. A bookcase is in the northwest corner, and a shelf is against the east wall. The family room is to the west and the study is to the north.

Office
This is your dad&apos;s office. However he doesn&apos;t use it a whole lot. You and your friends were only in here for a bit, but then you all moved to the guest bedroom, which is east of the study. There is a brown desk in the southwest corner. A bookcase is in the northwest corner, and a shelf is against the east wall. The family room is to the west and the study is to the north.
