•You’re character invited your friends over while your parents were away. You all explored around the house for a bit and then, your friends lock you outside of your own room. You have to find the extra key that you’ve hidden somewhere in the house, to get out.
•The puzzle that I created is having multiple objects you need to finish the game. After obtaining one, it will ultimately lead to the next item, and finally beating the game. However its up to the player to examine the objects and read carefully to be able to do this. 
•I created four rooms you can interact with, and a fifth room where you enter and automatically win. There is a Family Room, Office, Study and Guest Bedroom. There are several objects in the game, including 4 keys, a pamphlet and a flashlight. 
•I learned several methods, such as making a combination safe, making light variables, and making objects hide behind other objects. I figured these out by either looking them up in the inform program, or asking Mrs. Kiang for help. 
•I found the program really helpful, because I could type up something that I was looking for in the search bar, and it would bring up rules, instructions and examples on how to do these things if they were available.
