Family Room
This is where my friends and I were hanging out earlier. A carpet is in the middle of the room. A safe is on the north wall. A dresser is in the northwest corner of the room, while an armchair is in the southwest corner. An ern is near the door to the office in the northeast. The office is to the east. Your room is to the south.

Office
This is your dad&apos;s office. However he doesn&apos;t use it a whole lot. You and your friends were only in here for a bit, because you convinced them that it wasn&apos;t a good idea to stay. There is a brown desk in the southwest corner. A bookcase is in the northwest corner, and a shelf is against the east wall. The family room is to the west and the study is to the north.
