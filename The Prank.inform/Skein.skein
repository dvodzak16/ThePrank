(HINT: When unlocking the safe, type: spin safe to {Entire Value Here}

For example: spin safe to 1234)

Office
This is your dad&apos;s office. However he doesn&apos;t use it a whole lot. You and your friends were only in here for a bit, but then you all moved to the guest bedroom, which is east of the study. There is a brown desk in the southwest corner. A bookcase is in the northwest corner, and a shelf is against the east wall. The family room is to the west and the study is to the north.

Study
A hangout area for the house other then the family room. You remember that the lightbulb sputtered out while you and your friends were in there, making everyone retreat to your room. There is a grandfather clock in the the northwest corner of the room. A couch is resting against the north wall, and a potted ficus is in the southwest corner. A rug is sprawled across the floor. The guest bedroom is to the east, and the office is to the south.

You can see a brass key here.
